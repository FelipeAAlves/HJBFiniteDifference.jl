```julia
# solve a static equilibrium
using HJBFiniteDifference, Gadfly
π = 1.0
K = 3.8
ap = AiyagariProblem(π, K);
@time solve!(ap)

# solve a dynamic equilibrium
## construct an unexpected productivity shock π
dt = 0.5
π = Array(Float64, 400);
π[1] = 0.97
for t in 2:length(π)
    π[t] = 0.5 * 0.2 * (1.0 - π[t-1]) + π[t-1]
end
## solve along this shock
K = 3.8
apd = DynamicAiyagariProblem(π, K, dt = dt);
@time solve!(apd)
plot(x = collect(1:length(π)), y = apd.K, Geom.line)
